What's the difference between Recipes and RecipeList?  Where are those classes defined?

Your user stories describe a user, but not a story.  The story should include that user using the app, how they interact with it and what it does to meet their needs.

Your app should be serving your API, not hello world.

Think about what kinds of things "like and dislikes" might be and how you will use them.

I like your dashboard.  I would like to see more detail though - could you add a section where people breakdown the tasks into smaller bits?
